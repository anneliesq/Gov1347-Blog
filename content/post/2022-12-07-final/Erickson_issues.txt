INFLATION & THE ECONOMY
Inflation is hurting Oregon families—poor policies have led to a taxation on the lower- and middle-classes.
CRIME & PUBLIC SAFETY
Crime is out of control and communities are feeling unsafe. We need more law enforcement to protect our communities.
VETERANS
Honoring and supporting those who served our country is a priority. Mike will advocate for them to ensure they receive greater care and benefits.
IMMIGRATION
Preventing illegal immigration and expanding pathways to legal immigration is common sense policy.
ENERGY
We must bring back energy independence for America. We shouldn’t be relying on other countries for energy to run our country.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Supporting our infrastructure allows us to be a lead competitor in the world’s economy and provide a better quality of life for Oregon’s families.
HEALTHCARE
Ensuring access to high quality, low-cost healthcare for Oregonians is a must. And it starts with improving competition.
