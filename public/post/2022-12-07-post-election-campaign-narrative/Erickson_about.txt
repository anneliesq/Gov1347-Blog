Fighting Inflation & Growing our Economy
Let’s say what inflation is: a tax on America’s families. Incompetence by politicians and out-of-control spending policies have led to record inflation. Families are seeing massive price increases at the grocery store and gas pump. In Congress, Mike will vote to rein in spending and keep the government in check.


Protecting America’s Interests: At the Pump and the Border
Energy independence is a national security issue. It ensures that America can keep energy costs low for families. I will be a strong advocate to increase US oil production so that we can create jobs, lower costs for families, and increase security. We also need to secure the border to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into the country.


Protecting Our Environment
Mike cares about the environment and being a good steward of our resources while pledging to find green solutions to protect our climate and make America energy independent again.


Lowering Taxes & Bringing Back Fiscal Responsibility
Spending is out of control. Politicians nationally and in Oregon have made it their mission to put this country into more debt, causing inflation levels we have not seen in 40 years. Their actions are hurting Oregon families. As a small business owner, I understand that government spending and regulations are out of control. I will work to cut back regulations and rein in spending.
